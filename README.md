Develop a website that allows people to bring their event ideas to life through collaboration with  stakeholders and the target market or provide a platform to publicize events. 
The app allows users to post their events or suggest event ideas and allow other users to rate them eliminating the wastefulness of creating events people shall not attend
Stakeholders offering services such as event organizations are also able to see the ideas and offer their skills to people intended
There is also an avenue to allow for people who volunteer their presence for informal events such as estate meetups
We also cover online and hybrid events publicization through the different event categories that shall be present on the website
Not to forget automatically generated invites for weddings parties in communities such as schools, families after creation of the accounts
